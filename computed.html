        <!-- as you can see hear that we use guess as property and not execute it because
        vue will execute it for us and guess method will call once when page load so
        it can know about all dependencies as it happen in data properties and then
        unlike methods where we increase the counted and that guess method was also
        executed every time it will not be the case in computed properties -->
        <p>guess is: {{ guess }}</p>


        <!-- 4 -->
        <!-- hear we are using fillName like data property without () and when only 
        firstName will change then and only then fullName will execute not like methods
        which execute every time when something change
        vue is also smart enough that when we load page and firstName is '' as that
        time we click reset button then changed value of fires name will also be ''
        so that mins there is no change in data property actually so it won't execute
        fullName -->
        <input type="text" v-model='firstName'>
        <p> Full name: {{ fullName }} </p>
        <button v-on:click="resetFirstName">reset</button>

        <!-- NOTE: use computed property when you want to calculate or do some
        logic and want to output data on screen so that it won't re render every time
        and use methods to bind events in your app we can't use computed for that
        calculating and processing something and show to screen = computed
        to listen to events = methods -->
