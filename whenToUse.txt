1) methods = 
- when you want to bind events
- when you want to do some heavy tasks
- can use for data binding (try to always avoid) but keep in mind that if we use it for data binding it will always re render when anything change 

2) computed properties = 
- when you want to bind data
- when you want to do some processing on data and don't want to change actual data just want to return processed value and also want to show on screen

3) watch = 
- when you want to listen to data and computed property change and don't want to use that watch in template
- when you want to make simple and small tasks and mostly not want to change actual data
